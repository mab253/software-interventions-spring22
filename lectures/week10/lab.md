# ðŸ¤– lab, group work: deep dive on users, design justice, & accessibility

In your small group, take turns thinking through the following questions on each others' projects:

- What are some assumptions I have made so far about who the users are?
- Who is excluded when I make these current assumptions?
- What do I know about what practices already exist, what potential users are already doing, in the "problem domain"?
- As specifically as possible, define 1 example of a user for your project.

  - _For example: What devices are they using, and how? Are they working or are they at home (or working from home)? What kind of language are they used to using or reading? What other tools are they used to using? What technology are they using the most? Are they tired when they use this tool? Are they multi-tasking? Do they have other pressing responsibilities or other things grabbing their attention? What are they looking for when they use your tool? What problem are they actually trying to solve? What other social systems (perhaps race/class/gender/sexuality/ability) affect this person, and potentially their relationship to your tool?_ 
- What are the limitations of my own knowledge here? (Or, when, so far, am I potentially making this up, making more assumptions?!) How can I learn more?

After discussions, prepare a short presentation back to the group on each project. You can either present your own, or you can swap (i.e., someone else in your group presents your project and you present theirs). No need for visual aids here, but you are welcome to share slides if it's helpful.
