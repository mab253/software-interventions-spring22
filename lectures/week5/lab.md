**Please look for multiple sources, cross check! A lot of misinformation out there.**

Questions: 
- What systems are in play here, how is the technology trying to intervene?
- What technologies are people using and possibly subverting? How are they doing this?
- How does this depart from the intended use of the technology?
- What can we learn about our own tech projects with these case study examples?
