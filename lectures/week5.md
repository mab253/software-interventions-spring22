# ðŸ¤– lab, group work: tech in Ukraine

- Room 1: Google Maps 
- Room 2: Anonymous hackers
- Room 3: @RUOligarchJets, @PutinJet

Questions: 
- What systems are in play here, how is the technology trying to intervene?
- What technologies are people using and possibly subverting? How are they doing this?
- How does this depart from the intended use of the technology?
- What can we learn about our own tech projects with these case study examples?
