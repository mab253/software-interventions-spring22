# ðŸ¤– design sprint, group work: mutual aid network

In your group, design a tech-enabled system that facilitates connection at the neighborhood level. 

Let's imagine that refugees who need resettlement arrive where you live in NYC - in fact, this happens everyday. For this design sprint, we will imagine a scenario where many people come in need at the same time, **and** that there are groups of people in your neighborhood who are rallying and volunteer to house them, _or offer other help directly_, temporarily or permanently.

What software can you build that helps connect people in this situation? What tools will you need to build this? You will present your solution as a group at the end of class.

**NOTE:** you are encouraged to be creative! What do you want to build based on what you imagine peoples' needs might be?

- Please show us a sketch diagram of your system; what parts are required, and how are they connected?
- For each unit, choose a tool you think you might use (for a database, for example: a relational database? Redis? Google Sheets?), and suggest why 
- Show us also a simple "user journey," for 1 type of user you might have
- Think through some unique needs: is language an issue, for example? Clothes, food, education, childcare, a place to sleep ... 
- What could happen with your program @ scale?
- What is 1 question you would want to ask someone who would actually use your system?

You will probably want to divide the labor in your group! Everyone should present at least a portion of your idea at the end of class.
