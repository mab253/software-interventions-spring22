# 59866 - Senior Design I

**Instructor:** Madeline Blount \
**Term:** Spring 2022 \
**Time:** Mondays 6:30pm-9:00pm \
**Office Hours:** Tues/Thurs. by appointment, [schedule here](https://www.cal.com/mab253) \
**E-mail:** `mblount@ccny.cuny.edu` 

## course description

*In this two semester senior design course, we will explore and interrogate examples of software as intervention - how does software act in the world? How does what we build as software engineers interact with or intervene in systems that already exist? How might software change those systems, and how do these questions factor into software design? We will investigate the ethics of automation, scale, data collection, and data security, examining case studies of technology‚Äôs role in various fields, from physical sciences to politics, social justice, and the arts. We will use contemporary tools for rapid prototyping, including serverless architecture and modular development. Student projects will take original ideas through the phases of research, systems design, and prototype.* 

## what will we learn in this class?
- how to think critically about technology while we build it 
- how technology affects change in the world (hint: sometimes unexpected ways, with unintended consequences) 
- how to make rapid prototypes with contemporary tools to test our ideas 
- how to design systems with many moving parts, and think about how people fit into these systems 
- how to work together: iteration, collaboration 
- how to get comfortable reading documentation and using new tools quickly
- how to use the tools that you have learned to build your own creative project 

## course format

This course will meet *online only*. It will be both technical (code, design) and conceptual (some reading, writing, discussion).  Each week we will have:
- short readings or videos on a theme, to be completed before class (estimated time: 45 min.)
- a lecture in class, with discussion
- a code lab or discussion activity in class (group work)
- written or code assignment for next class

Our main goal is to create proposals for your final projects. We‚Äôll be examining many different case studies and examples in order to generate ideas, solving lots of small problems and building prototypes together - but you‚Äôll need to be thinking about your larger senior project throughout the arc of the first semester. 

Your final project could be in any language, using any methodology that you want, and you can either work on your own or as a team (3 students max). You will determine your topic and team by the end of this semester, and next semester we will work on the build. Your project proposal is this first semester's final project. Further description and requirements for the final project proposal will be clarified throughout the course.

There will be no textbook for this course other than what's linked here. I will post the readings at least 2 weeks in advance, but if you look far ahead you might see some "TBDs." I will also post any lecture material (slides, links, etc.) in a folder in this repo called `/lectures`. Information and instructions for any assigments will be in a folder called `/assignments`.

## tools we will use a lot

- Glitch: please get a free account, [here](https://www.glitch.com)
- Zoom: we will always start class here
- Blackboard 
- Node.js, npm

We will use other software development kits (SDKs), APIs, tools, places to meet and collaborate online, etc. throughout the course. This will be noted in specific weeks. 

## expectations and requirements  

- class attendence and punctuality: please come prepared and on-time for every class. 
- participate actively in lecture with questions, and discussion - ["move up, move up"](https://www.nasco.coop/sites/default/files/srl/AORTA%20Meeting%20Facilitation%20Resource%20Sheet%20July%202014.pdf)
- if you know you are going to miss class, please e-mail me. Attending and participating in every class counts towards your final grade (see below). Lateness beyond 20 minutes is considered an absence.

## evaluation:
Grading breakdown:
- Participation/Attendance: 25%

weekly assignments: 
- weekly assignments must be turned in _before_ the next class: this means **5:00pm Monday EST** - unless specifically noted otherwise
- weekly assignments are more for participation than in-depth feedback
- your weekly assignments are to help you prepare for your final proposal
- any late assignments = drop 10% per day
- you get to drop your worst assignment grade if you need to

## academic honesty and integrity:

Plagiarism is "the act of presenting another person's ideas, research or writings as your own." [(CUNY)](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy). [see what I did there ...?] **In all seriousness:** *please be mindful and cite your references*, both when you are writing in sentences and writing in code: Stack Overflow is a great resource, but your code cannot be copied and pasted for your assignments. Your work for proposals and written assignments must include citations when you are referencing others' work. 

You can find CCNY‚Äôs Acedemic Integrity Policy in full [here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy).  Do not plagiarize. 

## contact and questions

Please e-mail me - I am available for your questions! I try to respond within 24 hours. You are also invited to schedule some virtual office hour time to talk, [here](https://www.cal.com/mab253). If you need a time that's not on this schedule, please e-mail me.
