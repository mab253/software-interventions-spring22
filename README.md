# 59866 - Senior Design I

**Instructor:** Madeline Blount \
**Term:** Spring 2022 \
**Time:** Mondays 6:30pm-9:00pm \
**Office Hours:** Tues/Thurs. by appointment, [schedule here](https://www.cal.com/mab253) \
**E-mail:** `mab253@protonmail.com` (CUNY e-mail coming soon!)

## course description

*In this senior design course, we will explore and interrogate examples of software as intervention. We will investigate the ethics of automation, scale, data collection, and data security, examining case studies of technology‚Äôs role in various fields, from physical sciences to politics, social justice, and the arts. We will use contemporary tools for rapid prototyping, including serverless architecture and modular development. Student projects will take original ideas through the phases of research, systems design, and prototype.* 

## what will we learn in this class?
- how to think critically about technology while we build it 
- how technology affects change in the world (hint: sometimes unexpected ways, unintended consquences) 
- how to make rapid prototypes with contemporary tools to test our ideas 
- how to design systems with many moving parts, and think about how people fit into these systems 
- how to work together: iteration, collaboration 
- how to get comfortable reading documentation and using new tools quickly
- how to use the tools that you have learned to create your own project 

## course format

This course will meet *online only*. It will be both technical (code, design) and conceptual (some reading, writing, discussion).  Each week we will have:
- short readings on a theme, to be completed before class
- a lecture in class, with discussion
- a code lab or discussion activity in class (group work)
- assignment for next class

Our main goal is to create proposals for your final projects - we‚Äôll be studying a lot of different case studies and examples in order to give you ideas, and solving lots of small problems and building prototypes together, but you‚Äôll need to be thinking about your larger senior project throughout the semester. 

**More description of the final project expectations to come.** It could be in any language, using any methodology that you want, and you can either work on your own or with up to 3 total students as a team. We will have the proposals and groups set by the end of this semester, and next semester we will work on the build.

## key dates

## materials and references

All course material will be linked via the Blackboard and the Github here. There will be helpful links and extra references listed every week, beyond the required materials. There will be no textbook for this course other than what's linked here.

## tools we will use a lot
- Github: please get a free account, [here](https://www.github.com)
- Glitch: please get a free account, [here](https://www.glitch.com)
- Zoom: we will always start class here
- Blackboard 
- Node.js, npm

We will use other software development kits (SDKs), APIs, places to meet and collaborate online, etc. throughout the course. This will be noted in specific weeks. 

## expectations and requirements  

- class attendence and punctuality
- participate actively in lecture with questions, and discussion - "step up, step back" or "move up, move up" 
- we'll be sharing and critiquing each others' work - try to be honest and friendly, open and respectful when giving & receiving feedback

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.

## evaluation:
Grading breakdown:
- Participation/Attendance: 25%
- Weekly Assignments: 30%
- Final Project Proposal: 40%

weekly assignments: 
- weekly assignments must be turned in by the next class, so 6:30pm Monday EST.
- weekly assignments are more for participation than in-depth feedback
- many of your weekly assignments are to help you prepare for your final proposal
- any late assignments = drop 10% per day
- you get to drop your worst assignment grade if you need to

## academic honesty and integrity:

Plagiarism is presenting someone else‚Äôs work as your own.  Please be mindful of your references, both when you are writing in sentences and writing in code: Stack Overflow is a great resource, but your code cannot be copied and pasted for your assignments. Your work for proposals and written assignments must include citations when you are referencing others' work. 

You can find CCNY‚Äôs Acedemic Integrity Policy [here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy).  Do not plagiarize. 

## contact and questions

Please e-mail me - I am available for your questions! I try to respond within 24 hours. You are also invited to schedule some virtual office hour times to talk
