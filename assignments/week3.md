## Week 3: writing about project ideas

DUE: TUES. FEB. 22nd, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Write a new post on your Glitch class log. In this post, choose 2 ideas that you are potentially interested in for your final project - they do not have to be the same as the ideas you worked with last week, but **they absolutely can be,** if you want to continue working with these ideas.  

- For 1 of these ideas, think about what other tools, processes, and systems (software or otherwise) that people are using currently. What precisely is missing from what's currently available? Why might someone use (visit, encounter, choose, etc.) your project instead? Remember: this doesn't have to be because your project is an entirely new solution. What could be missing is simply a joyful experience, or one designed for a specific group of people, or one using a certain tool or underlying philosophy, etc.

- For the other idea, what components might be involved to make your project work? Do you envision a need for a database, any user interface, web server, etc.? Include a very basic visual - you can either sketch something by hand and upload a picture of that drawing, or create a simple digital diagram and upload it.

- For either idea, include 1 more visual image. Is this a picture of someone who might want to use your project? Is this an image of the space where someone might use it? Is this a picture of a cat that somehow reminds you of your project idea? Start to think visually as well as in words.

also - did you want to customize your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!

**How to add images to your blog:**

- Upload your file to the [Glitch assets folder](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/43-adding-assets/), and copy the URL of the uploaded image.
- You can use [Markdown](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/43-adding-assets/) in these blog posts, or HTML `<img>` tags to display your image.
