## Week 6: creating the simplest prototype

DUE: MON. MAR. 14th, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Choose the 1 idea that you are most excited about this week - this can be entirely new, or one that you have written about before. 

- Start working on a _very simple_ prototype for your idea; the main goal here is to have some sort of visual aid to show someone and to help explain your project. Simplicity is the idea here - you can create a "[paper prototype](https://usabilitygeek.com/paper-prototyping-as-a-usability-testing-technique/)," or you can create a very simple webpage. You could make a short video with lego blocks showing the interlocking pieces of your system, etc. etc.  Paper prototypes and sketches work great though! 
- It can be in any form that works for you - show us part of your system, from the perspective of what a user would see.
- Create a post on your Glitch log that documents your work on this prototype, with images.

**THINKING AHEAD:**

Testing your ideas with users who would _actually_ use what you've created is very important. Your next assignment (so, the one due on March 21 before class) will be to find just 1 person who would actually be a user of your program. Who are you designing for? How can you find this person? If you are creating something for children, talk to a kid in your family; if you are creating something for doctors, try and cold call your doctor or a professor @ CUNY to have a 15 minute conversation with you. This has to be a real person and a real conversation! I'm giving you a head's up so that you have 2 weeks in order to find someone.

also - did you want to customize your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!
