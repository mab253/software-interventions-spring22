## Week 12: storage

DUE: MON. MAY 2nd, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

What data are you storing for your project, and how? Is this user data, front-end content data, etc.? What are a few of your current options for tools that you will use to store this data, and how might your application connect to this storage solution? If you are not storing any data, how did you come to that decision? This is meant to be a place to start to take notes on this part of your proposal.

How did experimenting and thinking about an open web ("web3," etc.) make you think about storage differently for your project - or did it?

also - did you want to customize or design your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!
