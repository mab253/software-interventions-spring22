# ðŸ¤– extra credit opportunity:

If you want to make up some credit for late assignments (the weekly blog posts) or some class attendence you may have missed, please check out the videos here:

- [Mozilla Fest On-Demand](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/on-demand/previous-festivals/)

Choose a video from here on the topic of your choice - and there are hundreds listed here! - on AI, data stewardship, "fake news" and misinformation, race and gender in tech, etc. Add a new post to your Glitch log, at least 500 words, that connects what you learned from this video to something we have read in class and what you are building for your final proposal.

This extra credit assignment will be counted as either 1 class attendence or 1 blog post that you did not complete on-time - whichever makes your final grade _higher_.
