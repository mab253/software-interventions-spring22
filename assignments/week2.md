## Week 2: writing about project ideas

**DUE: FEB. 14th, 5:00pm**

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Write a new post on your Glitch class log. In this post, choose 2 ideas that you are potentially interested in for your final project - they do not have to be the same as the ideas you wrote down in the survey from Week 1, but they can be. What 'problem' might you be trying to solve with each idea, and who might use your software? What other systems (people, processes, current technologies, etc.) might be involved?

For 1 of these ideas, how might the ideas in the [Critical Engineering Manifesto](https://criticalengineering.org/) relate to how you approach your project? Choose 1 of the items from the Manifesto and write about it in relation to 1 of your project ideas. 

For the other idea, what are some examples of event-driven functions that could operate within your design? Try and list at least 3.

* also - did you want to customize your 11ty site a little bit more?
