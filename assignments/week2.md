## Week 2: writing about project ideas

**DUE: FEB. 14th, 5:00pm**

Write a new post on your Glitch class log. In this post, choose 2 ideas that you are potentially interested in for your final project - they do not have to be the same as the ideas you wrote down in the survey from Week 1, but they can be. What 'problem' might you be trying to solve with each idea, and who might use your software? What other systems (people, processes, current technologies, etc.) might be involved?

For 1 of these ideas, how do the tenets of the [Critical Engineering Manifesto](https://criticalengineering.org/) relate to your idea? 

For the other idea, what is an example of an event-driven function that could operate within your design?
