## Week 5: writing about project ideas

DUE: MON. MAR. 7th, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Write a new post on your Glitch class log. Choose the 1 idea that you are most excited about this week - this can be entirely new, or one that you have written about before.

- Return to our the idea of "do no harm," from the Hippocratic Oath and the Critical Engineering Manifesto. Knowing that many technologies are used in ways beyond their creators intended, can you think of a worst case scenario for your potential project? Who might be harmed, and how? What potential problems might this create in other systems (of people, of technologies, etc.) if something were to go wrong?
- Can you think of a creative, positive use for your tool besides your original intention?
- Include another visual for your log: this could be another sketch of a system diagram, another image of someone who might use your tool or a place where your software might be used, another image that reminds you of your project, etc. 

also - did you want to customize your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!
