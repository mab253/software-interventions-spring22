# ðŸ¤–ðŸ“„ final proposal 

due: Friday May 20th, 12pm EST 

**goal/audience:** Imagine that the reader needs to greenlight your proposal. Your words and images need to convince us that this is a new idea, one that solves a problem or opens up new possibilities. 

**format:** There is no standard template for software proposals! The sections below are in a suggested order. If you include all the required information and write clearly and persuasively, your proposal will be successful.

---

### Summary
- Give your project a working title, and describe it in 1 sentence. Brevity and clarity are powerful!

### Problem Space
- Tell us what you have researched and learned about the problem domain
- First give us the big picture, then get very specific about the distinct issue you are working on
- Cite at least 2 sources; and this section should be at least 500 words

### Current Ecosystem
 - What other tools (if any) try to solve this problem, or aim to do similar things? Why are they lacking?
 - How is your project going to intervene with current systems?

### Your Idea
 - Tell us precisely why you think your project is going to help in this domain - what are you automating?
 - This section needs to address why your project is innovative, new
 - Provide a very clear list of features

### Project Validation
- Cite your interview, with at least 2 quotes or specific stories
- Persuade us that this project is valuable to the users who need it most!
- **Do you maybe need more interviews here, to accomplish this?**

### User
 - Who is your user? This should be greatly informed by project validation interview(s), not purely imagined.
 - Be very, very specific - put us in their shoes, describe in detail their needs and how they come to your project
 - Walk us through 1 example of how they might use your tool
 - Address accessibility assumptions here

### User Map
- Where does your tool fit into the user's larger workflow, the larger system of the problem space?

### Do No Harm
- Walk us through at least 1 worst case scenario related to your project's build or release - is this about data security, mis-uses of the tool, a peril of automation, a problem of scale, a problem of exclusion, etc.? Tell us that you have thought about this, and suggest that you will build with this in mind.
- This section needs to be at least 300 words

### Work Plan
**NOTE:** While this does not have to be _the_ way that you are going to do it, this does have to be _one very clear way_ that you _could_ do it! Pivots happen. Your reader needs to know that you do have a plan for starting the work, even if it is not at all the plan you stick with.
- What are your "system requirements," unique constraints or necessities for your project's build? (Think security, accessibility, devices, user needs, etc.!)
- What tools will you utilize in order to build your project?
  - Get very specific here - if you are using a database, which one? What language will you be writing in? If you are using a pre-existing NLP algorithm, which one are you choosing and why? Are you using APIs to connect automations together?  
  - Tell us briefly why you are choosing the tools that you are, when you have options.
- Describe an order of operations for your build: where will you start, what steps will you take?

### System Diagram
- Show us how the various parts of your software (database, any API calls, external services, user interface, NLP/ML, etc.) function together. Where does your data flow and how?

### Final Media
- This section is open to your creativity. You need to create 1 more piece of media to add to your proposal - is this a cleaned-up version of your paper prototype? Is this a clickable prototype? Is this a rendering of the user interface? Is this a series of photos that you have taken, showing your problem domain? Is this an audio recording of part of your validation user interviews? Is this a short video describing your pitch, or using a paper prototype? Is this an animation showing how part of your system works?

optional: I will read a full draft (or finished section) of your proposal if I receive it with your questions by **May 10th.**
