## Week 11: diagrams

DUE: MON. APR. 25th, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Add a preliminary or rough draft sketch of either your user journey or your system architecture diagram ([see the final proposal instructions](https://github.com/mab253/software-interventions-spring22/blob/main/assignments/finalProposal.md)). This sketch could be digital or hand-drawn. There will be elements that you are not sure of yet, that you still have questions about.

What do you need to know more about at this point, in order to improve this draft? (More user research, another interview? More research into what components you will use? Tinkering to figure out how your components talk to each other?) 

also - did you want to customize or design your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!
