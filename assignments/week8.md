## Week 8: project feedback workshop

DUE: MON. MAR. 28th, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

What is 1 thing that you learned from the feedback sessions in class? This could be feedback on your own project, or ideas you had while listening to others' projects. How will you integrate this into the ongoing work on your project proposal?

Consider the readings (Hopper, Brooks, Graeber), and your project validation interview last week. Will your project "free up time" for your user, or does it have another purpose? 

also - did you want to customize or design your 11ty site a little bit more? optional!
