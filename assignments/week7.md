## Week 7: project validation

DUE: MON. MAR. 21st, 5:00pm

_Note: these are log entries mainly for you, to keep track as you generate ideas and walk closer to developing your project proposal. Please answer the questions in the format that is most helpful for you; take some time to be thoughtful, as it will help you later on in the semester!_

Choose the 1 idea that you worked on with your prototype, the same as last week.

- Conduct a preliminary user research interview for project validation. 
- The person you choose to interview should be a person who might _really_ use your tool - or as close to this as possible. 
- Use your prototype from last week to help explain your idea to them.
- Have a conversation that is @ least 30 minutes. 
- Create a new post for your Glitch log. Share some documentation of your interview notes (respecting the privacy of the person who you spoke with), and write 1 paragraph about what you learned during the interview.
- Remember: this is a qualitative interview, and should not feel like "grilling" or a "quiz"; listen to their ideas and experiences, and think later about how their insights affect your project

See slides [here](https://github.com/mab253/software-interventions-spring22/blob/main/lectures/week7/Week%207%20Automations%20%26%20Chatbots.pdf) #23-25 for sample questions and more direction.

**THINKING AHEAD:**

You will be sharing this idea with our class next week, for a Project Ideas Feedback Workshop!

- Prepare a 5-7 minute "pitch" for your idea. 
- Start by explaining the context of your software idea - what have you learned about the other societal systems, the people involved, the users' needs, etc.?
- Tell us about your proposed project, and walk us through your current prototype. 
- Tell us some insights from your project validation interview - how did it go?
- Address some of the issues of scale, "do no harm" - what are your potential red flags for this tool/project? How have you thought about avoiding these problems?
- What are you excited about learning, in terms of this project?
- Tell us if you are interested in collaborators. 

Be prepared to give constructive feedback to your classmates on their project ideas.
